I tend to spend a good portion of my day learning and implementing technical concepts in what I am interested in. This ranges from application security to cloud security and everything else in between. What follows is a collection of my technical learnings (My non-technical learnings can be found [**here**](/non-tech-learning/)).  

You can learn about my coding projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/tmendonca28).
