# Anthony Mendonca

I'm currently a Cyber Security Consultant at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/explore/home.html) working in the Applications and Infrastructure Security team on large cyber security transformation projects -- You can learn more about these from my [resume/CV](/cv/). I've also interned at both [BT](https://www.bt.com/) and [IBM Research Africa](https://research.ibm.com/labs/africa/).

I am interested in Application Security, DevSecOps and building scalable solutions securely.

I really enjoy learning about being the best version of myself and write a few articles on interesting reads [here](/non-tech-learning/). I also keep a record of learning technical concepts [here](/tech-learning/).
