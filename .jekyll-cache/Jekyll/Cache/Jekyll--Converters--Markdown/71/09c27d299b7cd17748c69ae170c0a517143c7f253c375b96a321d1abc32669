<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m a security engineer with a software engineering background. I have a strong interest in product and cloud security as well as developing security solutions that would better secure a given product or organisation.</p>

<p>I have an extremely strong work ethic, quickly adapt my ways of work to suit the problem at hand and analyse problems thoroughly (not to the extent of analysis paralysis) in order to develop the optimal solution.</p>

<p>I live in London, but I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. Iâ€™ve also spent a few years in Belfast where I did my MSc. in Applied Cybersecurity at Queenâ€™s University Belfast.</p>
