## Summary

Iâ€™m a security engineer with a software engineering background. I have a strong interest in product and cloud security as well as developing security solutions that would better secure a given product or organisation.

I have an extremely strong work ethic, quickly adapt my ways of work to suit the problem at hand and analyse problems thoroughly (not to the extent of analysis paralysis) in order to develop the optimal solution.

I live in London, but I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. I've also spent a few years in Belfast where I did my MSc. in Applied Cybersecurity at Queen's University Belfast.


## Experience

### [Deloitte](https://deloitte.com/) &ndash; Cyber Risk Consultant &ndash; September 2021 to present

*  Developing a secure network design for a Swiss luxury watch maker. This involves implementing network security
best practices, conducting threat modeling using the MITRE ATT&CK framework and ultimately building out a 3-year
network security strategy
*  Developed technical implementation guidance with relation to ransomware server hardening for a global consulting
services client. Done using PowerShell scripts and Chef recipes
*  Developed a next generation secure network strategy implementation roadmap that would underpin the global
network security transformation for a multinational consulting services client. This included adoption strategies for
Secure Access Service Edge and Zero Trust
*  Developed low-level system implementation guidance to improve the current security posture for a national
scientific research client. This was a post-vulnerability assessment activity and improved the organizationâ€™s security
posture by 75%
