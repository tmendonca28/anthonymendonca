In my opinion, one of the main takeaways is that **life does not have to be as hard nor as complicated as we set out to make it**.

The book talks about 3 key areas to focus on in order to make tasks effortless.

## 1. Effortless State
This is synonymous to being in the zone and usually occurs when one is physically rested, emotionally unburdened, and mentally energised.  
For a task to become effortless, we need to do the task in the right way.  A key word highlighted was **Effortless Inversion**; which implies looking at problems from an opposite and different perspective. It involves asking the question "What if this task could be easy?".  
To achieve an effortless state, we should look into developing a ritual, which goes along the lines of "when I do X, I also do Y".   We should couple difficult tasks with something that provides you psychological satisfaction. This allows us to provide ourselves a reward stimulus after achieving something difficult. It also can act in a way to keep ourselves motivated and not thinking negatively i.e. "Each time I complain, I will say something I am thankful for". In this way, it allows us to counter our negativity.  

## 2. Effortless Action
This implies accomplishing more by trying less. Starting on a given task is more important than procrastinating; this "start" will provide us with the much needed push to accomplish what needs to be done. It is very similar to the way the **activation energy** works in chemical reactions.  
Clear goals for a given task also allow us to make action easier. Thus, to get started on a given project, we need to first define what "done" or "good" looks like (similar to security transformation projects in consulting).  
Then try and set an effortless pace; this implies that slow actions are translated to smooth actions, which in turn are translated to fast actions. This is, progress.  
It is also important to set a right range for action so that every effortless action is done in moderation. This means, I will not do more than X nor will I do less than Y.  

## 3. Effortless Results
To achieve the above, it implies not achieving a result once by means of intense effort, but to achieve a single result time and again in an effortless fashion.  
This comes from understanding first principles really well, and then applying them over and over when it comes to different engagements. Think of it as creating a template for action.  
Some good points to "create a template" would be to read books as they serve as great experiential teachers and allow use to leverage activities used in prior scenarios to the scenario at hand. One very important point mentioned is **to learn, teach**. This cements knowledge within as well as allows for full internalisation when explaining said knowledge in a more easily digestible fashion to others.  
Automation is a very important word here; aim to automate as many essential tasks as feasibly possible. This allows you to free the brain for more intensive thinking.
